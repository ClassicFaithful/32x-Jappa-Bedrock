# How to Download .zip File

## If the .zip file does not show up when put in your resource pack folder:

Unzip the file using any program like Winrar, 7zip, or Archive Utility. Sometimes GitHub has a bug where the folder that is created when decompressed has a second folder within it, breaking the structure. To solve this, simply drag the second folder inside the decompressed one into your resourcepacks folder. Sorry for the inconvenience.
