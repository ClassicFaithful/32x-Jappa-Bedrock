# Installation

Drag the .zip file into your resourcepacks folder. While bedrock generally uses the .mcpack format, this is not easy to import into GitHub and as such on mobile you will need to use a file explorer to drag the file from your downloads into your resourcepacks folder in minecraft/games/com.mojang/resource_packs.

## If the .zip file does not show up:

Unzip the file using any program like Winrar, 7zip, or Archive Utility. Sometimes GitHub has a bug where the folder that is created when decompressed has a second folder within it, breaking the structure. To solve this, simply drag the second folder inside the decompressed one into your resourcepacks folder. Sorry for the inconvenience.
